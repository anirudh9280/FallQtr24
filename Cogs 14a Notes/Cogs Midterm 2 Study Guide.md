• During data analysis, why do you sometimes need someone to help who is blind to the  
hypothesis? What does this mean?  
- *ensure that data is not picked to fit the hypothesis*
• Be able to explain why communication of results is important for the scientific process.  
- submitted to peer review journals which analyze the findings and ask for changes
- *also the number of articles published for a journal is good for author*
What format do papers tend to follow in psychology (and some parts of Cognitive  
Science)?  
- *abstract, intro, method, results, dicussion*
• Understand how the different sections of peer-reviewed journal papers relate to the  
steps in the scientific process.  
- *intro has hypothesis, methods has research design and data collection, results has analysis, discussion has the facts*
• How is the impact factor of a journal calculated and what does this reflect? How is the  
h-index used? How can this help use choose between competing authorities?
- *h-index is how many citations an author's journal has in spawning articles*

• We talked about the challenges of measurement, and choice of research methods in  
Cognitive Science, due to the units of analysis of the constituent disciplines.  
Understand how the units of analysis differ and how this relates to the recording  
methods they will tend to require.  
- *we have to operationalize variables for our experiment to make sense, but there is no best way. it doesn't really matter as the scientific method means that we are doing something right.*
• Be able to explain the use of non-experimental (e.g. field studies, survey and  
interviews, longitudinal studies, and case studies) and experimental methods, and when  
each might be more appropriate.  
- *non-experimental studies are when you cannot manipulate something. field-study is when you observe people in their natural setting. longitudinal studies are tracking changes in an individual group over time. case studies are when you examine individuals with rare conditions or diseases*
• We discuss a number of experimental methods and measurement techniques.  
Understand the theoretical assumptions of each and why its advantages (or  
disadvantages) make it a good (or poor) fit to test a given research hypothesis.  
- *advantages are there is high ecological validity and there is a lack of control which allows for unexpected observations. disadvantages are that there are many confounds and there is observer bias, and we cannot make casual inferences, and we cannot replicate*
• What are some applications of reaction time (mental chronometry) and eye tracking?  
- *quantify the onset of some cognitive operation. longer eye fixation means more interest and pupil diameter in response to some changes is also telling*
Lecture 10  
• We discussed a number of recording methods including reaction time (mental  
chronometry), eye-tracking, EEG/ERP, MEG, CT, PET, fMRI, and DTI. While you  
don’t need to know the fine details of each method, be clear on when the methods are  
more useful and how they (generally) operationalize the dependent variable.  
- *EEG/ERP is for electrical forces through scalp and this is to show how brain activity changes and this is temporal and non-invasive, but there is poor spatial resolution and participants cannot move. MEG is magnetic fields produced by neurons (temporal safe but limited). CT/PET 3-D image of living brain and highlights damage of brain PET does blood tracers to show where the blood is in brain, bad temporal resolution fMRI is the track of blood flow through brain through oxegenation level signal (BOLD) and shows how glucose and oxygen is replaced w blood flow.(good spatial but bad temporal). DTI providesd image of white matter or myelin sheaths.*
• How is TMS used and how does this differ from the above?  
- *used to induce an electrical current in the neurons and stimulates activity, not just measure. it also determines which brain areas are necessary for certain functions. (non invasive but can induce seizures, also this is an independent variable)*
• Understand the history of unethical practices like those in the Tuskegee syphilis  
experiment, the Henrietta Lacks case, and project MKUltra. How did these cases affect  
issues of public trust in science and the government?  
- *syphilis experiment was studying progression of syphilis in 600 african americans and treatment was withheld. henrietta lacks had her tumor cells biopsied without her permission but this caused the polio vacicne and cancer research. mkultra was research by the CIA to see the behavioral control done to indivi*
Lecture 11  
• Note how the above historical cases and World War II atrocities contributed to the  
establishment of the Nuremberg Code and Declaration of Helsinki. Note that these  
early documents focused on the issue of consent.  
- *established the first protocols for working with human subjects, 10 principles about consent benefits to society and no coercion. the declaration of helinski refined the elements of the nuremberg code and used as a basis for treatment in Europe and US.*
• Be able to explain how the Milgram obedience experiments and Stanford prison  
experiment violated key issues of free and informed consent, and put the participants at  
risk. What other issues did these experiments have in common?  
- *long term psychological effects in the people participating*
• Be able to identify and apply the principles of the Belmont Report (respect for  
persons, beneficence, and justice) to examples given. Be prepared to explain how a  
principle is (potentially) being violated.  
- *respect for persons, beneficence, justice*
• Be able to distinguish free consent from informed consent.  
- *informed consent is when they know what they're getting into*
• What is the standard of risk that must be met in an experiment?  
- *minimal risk*
• Know the limitations of deception and use of a confederate in an experiment. When is  
it allowed and how does debriefing help balance the ethical concerns involved?  
- *sometimes we need to hide the intentions behind the experiment to avoid the issues with demand characteristics but the people have to know what they're getting into*
• Understand the role of an institutional review board and how it functions. What is its  
primary goal? How are the interests of animals protected in research?  
- *protect human participants from physical and psychological harm*
• Be able to identify and describe an example of scientific misconduct. Why are these  
cases bad for science?  
- *violating the integrity codes and data falsification. this damages the reputation of science and replication crisis when people struggle to get the same results as you when they recreate your experiment. this is done for ego and financial rewards.*
• Why is it important to know who is funding research? How does this potentially impact  
cases of scientific misconduct? What are the motivations?  
- *tobacco companies can fund sham research that puts down studies against tobacco*
Lecture 12  
• Be familiar with the examples of scientific misconduct we discussed and some of the  
consequences of their actions. What mechanisms are in place to investigate and punish  
these cases?
- *guidelines and institutions that investigate allegations. there is a office of director of investigation which has the same guidelines as UCs. punishments can vary and can be negotiated with the individual*
• Be able to explain how to do a boolean search and how this can be used to find  
relevant research articles. Which operators expand or limit the search?  
- *keyword search which can refine search criteria and narrows or widens it. dimentia AND smoking would pull up all of the articles that are related to these two topics*
• Note why it is important to use different search engines when doing a literature search.  
- *there is always a lot of bias in the algorithms that are used by the search engines*
What is a good resource for finding biomedical or neuroscience data?  
- *pubmed gov*
• Understand the role of citations in published papers (e.g. link to ongoing research and to  
avoid charges of plagiarism). What is the format typically used in Cognitive Science?  
- *APA citation*
• What is the difference between a reference section and a bibliography?  
- *reference is for in text footnotes, and bibliography is at the end and is a collective of all your sources*
• Why are websites and blog posts generally less reliable as sources of information?  
- *bias, not have research*
Think back on our discussion of peer review in journals. How does this relate back to  
‘ways of knowing’?  
- *authority?*
Lecture 13  
• Review the nature of operational definitions and how they act as a proxy for  
theoretical constructs.  
 - *if you want to test happiness, how are you going to choose a variable to measure this?*
• Be able to explain why it is important for a convenience sample to be representative of  
the population of interest.  
 - *ecological validity*
• Know the difference between a parameter and a statistic. Where do your sample  
statistics come from?  
- *parameter is some value that is associated with the entire population and statistics is the same value but only obtained in the sample.*
• Be clear as to why sampling error ensures that our sample statistics (usually) won’t  
match our population parameters. What is the role of variability?  
- *intrinsic variability*
• Understand conceptually what a normal distribution is and its basic characteristics.  
- *bell shaped and have means, medians*
• Note how we will use distributions of scores to determine what is a common or rare  
value in our population.  
Lecture 14  
• Be able to identify different scales/levels of measurement (nominal, ordinal, interval,  
and ratio). See the summary graph in lecture for examples.  
- *qualitative (nominal ordinal), quantitative (interval, ratio). nominal - exist without any type of ordering, color of shit. ordinal is categories that are organized in an ordered sequence. qualitative measurements are interval - set of ordered categories where the categories form equal size. ratio is similar to interval but there is a true zero which is the total amount, temperatures in kelvin is a good example, speed, distance, income.*
• Why is it safer to treat rating scales (e.g. rating happiness on a scale of 1 to 7) as ordinal  
rather than interval? Can we ever treat them as interval?  
- *jump between scale of 1-2 is often higher than a jump of 5-6 which means that there is no fixed interval between each values. this is unsafe to treat as intervals.*
• Know the difference between discrete and continuous data.  
- *discrete is isolated numbers with no categories or values between neighboring categories. continous is potentially infinite values between any two observed values and this is finer measurement.*
• Be familiar with the measures of central tendency (mean, median, and mode), their  
strengths and weaknesses, and the scales of measures for which they are appropriate.  
- *mean is fucked by outliers and has to be done in interval or ratio. median is good from ordinal and this is not affected by outliers. mode is central tendency and the mode of the samples greatest frequency of something, this is good for interval ratio nominal or ordinal data., this will be affected by outliers*
• Know how to describe distributions by skew and mode.  
• Know which measure of dispersion (range, variance, or standard deviation) is critical  
for understanding the average amount of variability in some data.  
- *skew is to see if there are extreme values. range, STD, and variance are good to see the dispersion of data among a data set.*
Lecture 15  
• Understand how statistical tests compare the difference between groups vs. the  
difference within groups and the role that error plays.  
• Be able to identify when t-tests and F-tests (ANOVAs) are appropriate given the scale  
of the dependent variables.  
- *for nominal data we use chi-squared test. for ordinal data, we used the mann-whitney U or Wilcoxon ranked sum tests for two samples. for quantitative data we use the student's t-test which is used for two samples or the fisher's F-test which can be used for more than two samples*
• In general, why is the scale of the data so important for determining what kinds of  
statistical analyses can be used?  
- *the scale of the data matters because we can make sure we pass Type II errors if we test for quantitative data*
• We review the basic form of statistical tests and how they compare the effect of your  
independent variable with the amount of error that is present. What role can nuisance  
variables play and how do they tend to impact our experimental results?
- *if there is larger variability between groups rather than within groups, we can claim that there are nuisance variables and the formula would be difference between groups/difference within groups = effect of independent variable + error/error*

• Understand how bivariate data is visually represented in scatter plots. Recognize what  
scales of data are appropriate for this.  
- *scatter plot, x is your independent and y is your dependent*
• Be prepared to describe the direction and strength of correlational relationships in a  
given graph. Have a basic understanding of how Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r)  
can be used to represent the direction and strength of relationships.  
- *positive correlation is when one thing increases, so does the other*
• Know the difference between interpolation and extrapolation.  
- *interpolated is when the data points being predicted lie within the range of existing data, if you get data that is outside the range, you are extrapolating*
• Be able to explain the difference between spurious relationships and third variable  
- **spurious is when there is correlation between two variables that are not naturally causated**
problems.  
Lecture 16  
• Know the strengths of correlational studies (e.g. examining subject variables) and their  
weaknesses (e.g. lacking causal explanations).  
• Understand the nature of a between-groups design experiment and why it is important  
to start with equivalent groups before manipulating an independent variable.  
• Be able to identify the difference between sampling bias and sampling error. Note  
how pre-screening can be used when creating equivalent groups.  
• When assigning subjects to groups, understand why selection bias may be a problem  
(and how it can be controlled with random assignment and matching assignment).  
• We review a number of confounds (uncontrolled extraneous variables). Be able to  
recognize experimenter bias, demand characteristics  
• How do single-blind and double-blind designs help control for demand characteristics  
and experimenter bias?
