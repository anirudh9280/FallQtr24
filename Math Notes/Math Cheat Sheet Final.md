**Lecture 21**
- triangular matrices diagonal entries are the eigenvalues
- two nxn matrices are similar if there exists an invertible nxn matrix such that A = PBP^-1
- similar matrices have the same eigenvalues
- if two matrices have the same eigenvalues, they do not have to be similar
- if one of the entries on a diagonal matrix is a zero, it is not invertible
- If there is a matrix A, a matrix P, and a matrix D and we know that A=PDP^-1, A^K = PD^kP^-1.

- a matrix A is diagonalizable if A = PDP^-1
- in general, [a 1; 0 a] is not diagonalizable

- in general, the multiplicity of lambda is always greater than or equal to the dimension of the eigenspace 
- matrices with distinct eigen values are diaganolizable

- values are diagnolized 
**Lecture 23**
- a nxn matrix is diagonalizable if it has n distinct eigen values
- the normalization of a vector is if you divide it by the magnitude of said vector
- the distance between two vectors is the magnitude of the first vector minus the second vector
- cos theta = u . v / ||u||||v|| 
- |u . v| = |cos theta| . ||u|| . ||v|| <= ||u||.||v||
- two vectors are orthogonal if their dot product is 0 
- ||u-v||^2 = ||u||^2 + ||v||^2
