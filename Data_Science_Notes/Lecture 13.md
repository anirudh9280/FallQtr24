## Algorithm Complexity

- algorithmic complexity is an important topic to see how long algorithms take and how much space they take too 
- it also determines what data structures to use 
- in the worst case of searching for an item in a list, it would be O(n) because we don't know if the required element is at the end of the list
- [[Big O Notation]] is important
