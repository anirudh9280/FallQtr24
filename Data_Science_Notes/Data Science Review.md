From midterm (Part 1 of the Final):
1. Loops: for and while, nested loops
2. Conditional statements: if, else, elif. Boolean and short circuiting 

    
3. None. return vs print
    
4. Lists, String, Tuples: basic operations on them, slicing. 
    
5. Dictionaries: operations on them
    
6. Mutable/Immutable data types. 
    
7. Files: how to read/write/append to/from the file.
    
8. List comprehensions.
    
9. Lambda Functions.
    
10. Iterators, map and filter.
    
11. Higher-order functions.
    
12. Advanced argument passing: default arguments, *args and **kwargs
    

1. Their order in a function header
    

1. What is a function header?
    

14. Scope of the variables: how Python looks up variable names and their values. 
    
15. Complexity (questions similar to HW5)
    
16. Recursion: be able to write a recursive function and trace a given recursive code (questions similar to HW6)
    

  

After midterm  (The rest of the Final):

  

1. Doctests
    
2. Asserts
    
3. Longer recursive questions. 
    
4. Classes and Objects:
    

1. Definitions, how to create and use
    
2. Difference between function and bound method
    
3. self
    
4. Instance variables vs. class variable
    
5. Method that belongs to the class vs. method that belongs to the instance vs. static methods
    

6. Inheritance
    

1. Purpose
    
2. How it works

4. Method overriding
    

8. Special methods:
    

1. Repr and str

2. How do they work?
    
3. How to write your own. 
    

10. Mutable data, mutable operations, mutable functions 
    
11. What does it mean that the algorithm is in-place?
    
12. Exceptions
    

1. Exceptions handling
    

1. try/except
    

3. Raising exceptions
    

14. Comparison: is vs ==
    
15. Idea of shallow copy/deep copy
    
16. Sets: definition and syntax. (but if I ask, it will be for extra credit). 
    
17. The idea of ASCII and Unicode. (but if I ask, it will be for extra credit).
