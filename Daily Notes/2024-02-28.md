	- triangular matrices are invertible

	- if f(x) has an inverse, it is onto and one to one
	- if there is a linear transformation T, T is invertible if A is invertible. T$^-1$(x) = A$^-1$x
	- one to one means pivot in every column (linearly independent) and onto means pivot in every row
	- a vector space is a collection of V objects called vectors

- lecture 12
	- all polynomials are a vector space
	- but cannot leave a vector space during operations such as cancelling out the highest degree
	- differentiable and continuous functions are vector spaces
	- a subspace is 
		- 1. 0 vector belongs to W, 
		- if p(t), q(t) in W, p(t)+q(t) in W,
		- if p(t) in W and c belongs to R and cp(t) in W
		- if these conditions are met, then W is a subspace of V`
		- intersections are subspaces but unions are not
	- lecture 13
		- span of v is a subspace of V the vector space
		- when finding the span columns of matrix, find the columns w pivots and then use those columns. because the non-pivotal columns of A are linear combinations of the pivotal columns
		- if you have a mxn matrix A, the null space Nul A = all x vectors in Rn that Ax = 0, nul A is a subspace of Rn
		- the null space is the solution to the homogenous system, where its like free vars times vectors

		- Ker T is the Nul A
		- image of T is Col A
	- lecture 14
		- if polynomials in a set can equal to 0 as a linear combination, they are linearly dependent
		- if V is a vector space, W is a subspace of V, and B is a basis of W if 
			- 1. B is linearly independent
			- span B = W
		- any basis of Rn has exactly n elements 
		- to get the basis for the column space of A, you put the columns of A that match up with the pivots from the row reduction step
		- for the basis of the row space of A, you put the rows from the row reduced matrix 
			- because elementary row operations change the col space, but not the row space
	- lecture 15

		- if a basis of V, B has n elements, all other bases of V also have n elements
		- the dimension of a vector space is the size of the bases, this can also be 0 or infinite
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 12.50.11 AM.png]]
		- to find the dimensions of a vector space, find the homogenous solutions that are linearly independent, and then the # of those is the # of dimensions. 
		- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-01 at 12.51.14 AM.png]]
		- For any matrix A, the rank is the dimensions of the Col space, and this would be equal to the dimensions of the Row space too and the number of pivots
		- the nullity of A is the dimensions of the Null space
		- The rank + nullity = n columns of the matrix

	- lecture 16
	- lecture 17
		- if A is invertible, det A cannot be 0
		- you can multiply the edges of a triangular matrix to get the determinant
		- computing determinant for an nxn matrix takes n! operations
		- if a matrix has a column or rows of 0s, the determinant is always 0

	- lecture 18
		- det(AB) = det(a) x det(b)
		- if A is invertible, det(a^-1) = 1/det(a)
		- det A^T = det A
		- The inverted matrix is the adjacent matrix of A times 1/detA
		- absolute value of the determinant of two vectors is the area of that they span 
		- determinant of three vectors is the volume between the shape that they form
