- if you take two small similar size samples from the population, both samples will have varying levels of independent variables
- this is called between group design 
- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 12.19.29 AM.png]]
- to find the variability between groups compared to within groups, you can use
- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 12.20.54 AM.png]]
- now that the groups are roughly equivalent, you have to ensure that there are no other confounds
	- are our measurements valid and is there internal validation 
- experimenter bias is when the experimenter interprets the data to be more like the expected result
- demand characteristics are when the participant themselves pick up a cue that would lead them to act differently
- double blind procedures are when you ensure that both the participants and the experimenter do not know the experimental conditions
- **attrition** is when the participant decides to leave experiments in progress
	-  non-systemic is when they get sick or some shit
	- systemic is when they get bored of the task and decide to leave, this could happen fi they wanted caffeine and got a decaffeinated beverage and found the task boring
	- error variance is due to the sensitivity of the dependent variable
	- if your measurements are capped by instrumentation, this can be called the ceiling effect, the floor effect is when your measurement scale is too high 
	- advantages/disadvantages of between-group design 
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 12.33.06 AM.png]]
	- within group design is when the participants experience all levels of the independent variable
	- this greatly reduces error variability because there is an elimination of inherent differences in the subject variables like sex, culture, background, age
	- within subject design reduces the effect of Type II errors
	- Two types of designs 
		- Pretest-posttest design: Participants are tested once before and once after the independent variable is manipulated
		- repeated-measures design: more measures are taken from each participant and they can be in any order
		- longitudinal distances are when you can measure participants over the years
		- pretest-posttest design

- Review experimenter bias and demand characteristics, since we keep running into  
these issues.  
**Lecture 18**
- pretest post-test design 
	- participants are tested once before and once after the IV is manipulated
	- mixed design is repeated measures that are combined with between groups design, this is crossed over with repeated measures design
	- repeated measures design is when participants undergo al conditions of IV in order to test different levels of IV in the same participant
	- disadvantages of within group design is that there are a lot of demand characteristics because repeated exposure to stimuli makes it easier to figure out the aim of the experiment, changing behavior
	- confounds over the life of the participant can affect the results
	- carryover effects are due to the order the IV levels were given 
	- practice effects are when the task becomes easier with practice
	- have practice trials before the actual experiment to resolve this
	- balance the way in which conditions are presented in some way - counterbalancing
	- advantages of a within group design is that there is greater statistical power due to the lesser error variance
	- disadvantages are that the participants are given more info (demand characteristics), time testing (potential confound), and order of IV treatments can introduce carryover effects
**Lecture 19**
- pre-experimental design
	- people are not randomly assigned to groups
	- people self-select and there are many confounds
	- there is a potential for statistical regression towards the mean
- Quasi-experimental design
	- allows for gathering of data but without randomization
	- there will be a control group or multiple measures
	- stronger than pre-experimental designs but gives weaker casual explanations than true experiments

- if the researcher took multiple measurements of an acquired planet, and took measurements of a similar control group that did not get acquired, this makes it a multiple times series design 
- if the researcher only took before and after measurements of an acquired planet and had no control group, this would be a pre-experiment 
**Lecture 20 **
- threats to the quasi-experiment design are:
	- history effects - DV changes for reasons that are unrelated to the study
	- maturation effects are when the DV changes for reasons internal to the participant
	- testing effect is when being tested causes changes
	- selection bias is when participants are chosen in a non-random fashion
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 1.43.17 AM.png]]
	- ANOVAs/F tests
		- examine the difference between more than two samples (or more than two levels of an IV)
		- can also be used for multiple different IVs with each one described as a factor of ANOVA
		- you measure the difference in sample means, the null hypothesis would be that mu1 = mu2 = mu3 = mu4 and that no dosage has an effect
		- alternative hypothesis is that the null is false and some dosage has an effect
		- when there are more than one IVs, it becomes a factorial design

	**Lecture 21**
	- look at the slides
	- ANOVAs are for examining multiple groups at once without raising the probability of a type I error (unlike doing a t test for every single possibility)
	- adding a factor for an ANOVA means doubling the amount of means to compare
	- cross-sectional studies are when you collect data from a population at one point of time coming from many different groups
	- good for exploratory and descriptive studies
	- these group types would be an independent variable
	- advantages - cost efficient, fewer logistic problems
	- disadvantages - can only find differences in groups without providing casual relationships, cohort effects, (differences in how groups developed differently)
	- longitudinal studies are when you collect data from a population in multiple points of time
	- time is an independent variable
	- advantages - better for understanding casual relationships and in depth understanding of complex behaviors and processes
	- disadvantages - resource intensive, very expensive
	- trend studies, cohort studies, prospective studies, retrospective studies

	**Lecture 22**
	- cross-sectional - uncover age related differences between groups
	- longitudinal data can uncover age related over time and will give a more accurate picture of the data
	- natural settings in research have high ecological validity but you also have less control over shit
	- naturalistic observations are when the researcher remains unobtrusive, and minimize the interaction with the group and behaviors being observed
	- covert - researcher hidden or not present and uses a device but this isn't always ethical
	- overt - researcher present but not an active participant 
		- requires care to change the nature of the monitored behavior
		- desensitization - getting progressively closer, used in animal studies to decrease fight or flight
		- habituation - repeated exposure until presence is ignored and doesn't affect behavior
	- participant observations are when the researcher becomes an active participant 
		- undisguised - when the researcher joins the study group but he is recognized as an outsider
		- disguised - subjects are blind to the researcher's role 
	- field experiments are when the researcher studies the phenomenon of interest in real life scenarios 
		- often only way to get info, allows for casual inference and ecological validity, has less control over extraneous variables
**Lecture 23**
- Problems with observational studies
	- ethical concerns often have a lack of free and informed consent as well as potential for harm 
	- can't make casual inferences due to lack of IV manipulation
- presence of observers may influence behavior impacting ecological validity
- change in behavior because they are being observed - Hawthorne Effect
- collecting data/sampling techniques -

**Lecture 24**
 - surveys should have funnel structure - going from easy to harder/specific questions
 - filter questions, your responses to one of the questions changes the next ones you see
 - personal demographics come at the end 
 - types of validity -

**Lecture 25**
- survey reliability/surveys and interviews:
	- ![[Screenshot 2024-03-18 at 2.32.18 PM.png]]
- reactive measures are when taking measurements influence a participant's behavior
- non-reactive measures are when taking measurements in the absence of the participants 
- physical trace studies:

	- btw measuring a buildup of dust is natural accretion, not natural erosion check side 115
